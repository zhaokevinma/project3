# Virtual Hospital 1.0

"Sixty-three percent of US healthcare providers— that is, well over half— have plans to expand their local care centers, bringing medical attention closer to communities that need it, as well as allowing an “intermediate care” option for patients who are too ill to go home, but well enough to leave the hospital." - Estelle Schweizer 

However, the complex architecture of a traditional PACS (Picture Archiving and Communication Systems) is not appealing to these small clinics. Here we propose a cost-efficient software application that can be flexibly integrated into their patient data management methods.
